## 🧪 Sentiment Analysis (via Python)

Text sentiment was computed using **TextBlob** in Google Colab.  
Two new columns were added:
- `sentiment_score` → Numeric polarity (-1 to 1)
- `sentiment` → Label (Positive / Neutral / Negative)

The processed dataset was loaded into Power BI to enable dynamic sentiment visuals.
